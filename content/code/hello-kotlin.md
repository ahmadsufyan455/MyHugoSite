Kotlin is a programming language for android development.<!--more-->

I like this language because i'm currently learning to develop an android application using the kotlin language, and you know that **KOTLIN IS FUN**

fun = function yeahh...

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello Kotlin!")
}
```

One day I want to be an expert in using kotlin as the main language in android application development.
